The MTE website is the online platform for Brazil's Ministry of Labor and Employment (Minist√©rio do Trabalho e Emprego). It provides information and services related to labor regulations, worker's rights, job opportunities, and more.
One important feature of the MTE website is the CAGED (Cadastro Geral de Empregados e Desempregados) system, which is used to collect data on employment and unemployment in Brazil. Employers are required to report hiring, firing, and other employment changes through the CAGED system on a monthly basis.
The CCTS (Cadastro de Conformidade de Trabalho Seguro) is another system available on the MTE website. It is used to assess and certify the compliance of companies with Brazilian labor laws related to health and safety in the workplace.
Overall, the MTE website is a crucial resource for workers, employers, and anyone interested in labor regulations and job market information in Brazil.
